Introduction to Layout Design

Layout Design is the process of converting a circuit schematic into a physical representation that can be fabricated on a silicon chip. It involves defining the exact geometries and placements of different layers (like diffusion, polysilicon, metal) on the silicon wafer.

In CMOS technology, layout design is a critical step in the VLSI physical design flow, as it directly influences the performance, area, power consumption, and manufacturability of the circuit.
Layout Design:
Transistor Placement: Defining diffusion (active), polysilicon (gate), and contacts for NMOS/PMOS.

Interconnections: Routing signal paths using one metal layers (m1).

Verification Steps:

DRC: Design Rule Check – Ensures layout obeys spacing, width, and enclosure rules.

LVS: Layout vs. Schematic – Confirms the layout matches the schematic connectivity.

RC Extraction: For post-layout simulation to analyze parasitic effects.
